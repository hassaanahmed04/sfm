# Introduction

**Structure from Motion (SfM)** is a computer vision and photogrammetry technique that reconstructs the 3D structure of a scene and determines camera poses from a collection of 2D images. By identifying common features and solving mathematical equations, it transforms a set of images into a cohesive 3D representation, applicable in fields like 3D modeling, augmented reality, and historical landscape reconstruction.
